## Motivation

Although a long time has passed since Vue 3 announced, there are also many developer still stay on vue2 because dependency compatibly, browser support requirements, or other reasons.

The Vue team also have backported some important feature from Vue 3 like [composition-api](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html#what-is-composition-api) in Vue 2.7 which was last minor version of Vue 2.x.

If we just want create a UI library that follows design specification and can be use on both Vue 2 and Vue 3 project, How?

Fortunately, there was a Community solution a long time ago, [vue-demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi), so I built a template for building your universal ui libraries on top of this. take a try ðŸ˜‰
